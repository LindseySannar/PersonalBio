<!-- you only need to add one css file and link everything in the css,which is done in the css-->
<!-- you also have to add a list somewhere in your web page. maybe in the interests? also in the porfolio
of programming an stuff ive done-->
<!-- also see if you can add external links within the other pages like "home" and "interests"-->
<!--make sure that all html files are linked to the css fine-->
